# plan03-1 progress

## 2026-08-10T14:55:19+09:00 — PLAN_INIT

- Plan: `plans/DOING/plans/plan03-1.md`.
- Workflow: version 3 at commit `7d4a607b753744d9b57b54fe0400d1267b13cc40`.
- Dedicated branch: `plan03-1`; branch point
  `7d4a607b753744d9b57b54fe0400d1267b13cc40`.
- Host classification: Miyabi control plane (`miyabi-g1`, no `PBS_JOBID` or
  `PBS_NODEFILE`). Only source inspection, editing, Git/PBS control operations,
  and static shell checks are allowed here.
- Frozen startup artifacts: `inventory.md`, `requirement-matrix.csv`,
  `identity-authority.md`, `test-ladder.md`, and `artifact-schema.md`.
- Observation: the branch point has no tracked tests or runnable configs, while
  the package and documentation still expose versioned Full Protocol names,
  legacy readers, a second runnable baseline, stale entry points, and references
  to deleted scripts/configs.
- Decision: implement only the unversioned Full Protocol. No old API, config,
  schema, run-layout, legacy reader, migration, baseline, or compatibility path
  is retained.
- Next action: run the plan-init static self-check and freeze this startup state
  in Git before product implementation.

## 2026-08-10T14:55:19+09:00 — startup freeze self-check PASS

- Command: strict shell assertions over the branch/head, globally unique plan
  path, ten required startup artifacts, twelve unique requirement rows, all
  workflow-state keys, reviewer PBS shell syntax, absence of group placeholders,
  and `git diff --check`.
- Environment: Miyabi control plane `miyabi-g1`; no project runtime imported.
- Result: `plan-init static self-check: PASS`.
- Transition: `PLAN_INIT` → `IMPLEMENT_AND_DRAFT_TESTS`, phase
  `P1-current-protocol`, work unit `P1-W1-unversioned-surface`.
