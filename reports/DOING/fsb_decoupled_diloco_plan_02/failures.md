  ```

- Source state: branch `codex/fsb_decoupled_diloco_plan_02`, uncommitted Phase 0 probe implementation frozen for the duration of the job.

### Expected behavior

The script should create a job-specific work directory below `reports/DOING/fsb_decoupled_diloco_plan_02/artifacts/`, run the two-node probes, write one final Checker artifact, and delete only that job-specific work directory after `PASS`.

### Observed facts

- The executable workload started (`substate=42`), loaded `nvidia/25.9` and `nv-hpcx/25.9`, and reached the probe body.
- The job log printed `WORK_ROOT=/work/xg24i002/x10041`, which is the account work root rather than a job-specific directory.
- The parent environment already defined `WORK_ROOT`; the PBS script used `${WORK_ROOT:-...}` and therefore accepted that unrelated broad value.
- The success cleanup path was `rm -rf -- "$WORK_ROOT"`. Allowing the job to reach it could have deleted unrelated account data.
- Codex immediately submitted `qdel 2496503.opbs`. The job finished after 18 seconds before cleanup. No unfinished jobs remained.
- A nested scalar capability child, `2496506.opbs`, completed in one second and left an auditable child artifact. No array child was submitted before the parent was stopped.
- Run-generated files were created directly under `/work/xg24i002/x10041`; no repository or account data was observed deleted.

### Confirmed root cause

`WORK_ROOT` is too generic for a task-local override and collided with an environment value. This violates the repository safety rule against repurposing common system or environment variables and made the cleanup target unsafe.

### Next modification and falsification test

- Replace `WORK_ROOT` with a plan-specific variable such as `PLAN02_PHASE0_WORK_DIR` and do not accept an inherited override for the destructive cleanup target.
- Derive the directory only from the validated report root, timestamp, and PBS job ID.
- Before cleanup, resolve both paths and assert that the target is a strict child of `reports/DOING/fsb_decoupled_diloco_plan_02/artifacts/` with the expected `work_` prefix.
- Add a regression test that sets `WORK_ROOT` to a broad sentinel and verifies the script neither reads it nor contains a cleanup using it.
- Rerun focused tests before the second two-node attempt.

## 2026-08-06T01:07:00+09:00 — phase0-feasibility attempt 2

### Experiment identity

- Consecutive failure count: 2.
- PBS job: `2496515.opbs`, queue `debug-g`, `select=2:mpiprocs=4`, hosts `mg0005` and `mg0008`.
- Submission command:

  ```text
  qsub -o /work/xg24i002/x10041/fsb_decoupled_diloco/reports/DOING/fsb_decoupled_diloco_plan_02/artifacts/20260806-010700_phase0-pbs.log -v PROJECT_ROOT=/work/xg24i002/x10041/fsb_decoupled_diloco,STAMP=20260806-010700 scripts/miyabi/run_plan02_phase0_feasibility.pbs
  ```

### Expected behavior

Eight writers across two nodes should open the preinitialized shared SQLite database, execute 50 acquire/renew transactions each with bounded busy retries, and produce one result per writer without starvation or integrity failure.

### Observed facts

- The cleanup-target remediation worked: the job used the exact job-scoped directory `reports/DOING/fsb_decoupled_diloco_plan_02/artifacts/work_20260806-010700_2496515`.
- Writer-lock, old-cache-writer, source-pinning, and cross-node commit/reopen probes completed and wrote evidence before the contention stage.
- Four contention ranks failed while opening their connections. The exception was `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` at `PRAGMA synchronous=FULL` in `_configure_connection()`.
- The MPI job aborted at the contention command; the parent job finished after eight seconds. The Phase 0 Checker was not reached.
- A rollback journal remained because MPI terminated writers during the failed start; this is failed-run evidence, not an integrity conclusion.

### Confirmed root cause

`_configure_connection()` set `PRAGMA synchronous=FULL` before installing the requested `busy_timeout`. When eight processes opened simultaneously, some reached that PRAGMA after another rank had begun a write transaction and failed immediately instead of applying the probe's bounded wait policy.

### Next modification and falsification test

- Install a startup busy timeout before connection PRAGMAs, set `synchronous=FULL`, then reduce `busy_timeout` to the contention value used for measured transactions.
- Add a regression test that holds `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` while a contention process opens; release the holder within the startup timeout and require the contender to complete.
- Rerun the focused SQLite/Phase 0 tests before attempt 3.
